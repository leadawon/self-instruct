Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.

Written at Fleming's Goldeneye estate in Jamaica, it was first published in the United Kingdom by Jonathan Cape in 1958. In the novel Bond looks into the disappearance in Jamaica of two fellow MI6 operatives who had been investigating Doctor No. Bond travels to No's Caribbean island and meets Honeychile Rider, who is there to collect shells. They are captured and taken to a luxurious facility carved into a mountain. The character of Doctor No, the son of a German missionary and a Chinese woman, was influenced by Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu stories. Dr. No was the first of Fleming's novels to face widespread negative reviews in Britain, but it was received more favourably in the United States.\nOutput: English, British, Jamaica, the United Kingdom, German, Chinese, Britain, the United States.\n\nTask: Converting 85 F to Celsius.\nOutput: 85°F = 29.44°C\n\nTask: Sort the given list ascendingly. \nExample 1\nList: [10, 92, 2, 5, -4, 92, 5, 101]\nOutput: [-4, 2, 5, 5, 10, 92, 92, 101]\nExample 2\nInput 2 - List: [9.99, 10, -5, -1000, 5e6, 999]\nOutput: [-1000, -5, 9.99, 10, 999, 5e6]\n\nTask: Suggest a better and more professional rephrasing of the following sentence.\nExample 1\nSentence: This house is surprisingly not constructed very well, and you probably need more money to fix it after you buy it.

In 2018, the most recent year for which data are available as of 2021, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) National Center for Health Statistics reports 38,390 deaths by firearm, of which 24,432 were by suicide. The rate of firearm deaths per 100,000 people rose from 10.3 per 100,000 in 1999 to 12 per 100,000 in 2017, with 109 people dying per day or about 14,542 homicides in total, being 11.9 per 100,000 in 2018. In 2010, there were 19,392 firearm-related suicides, and 11,078 firearm-related homicides in the U.S. In 2010, 358 murders were reported involving a rifle while 6,009 were reported involving a handgun; another 1,939 were reported with an unspecified type of firearm. In 2011, a total of 478,400 fatal and nonfatal violent crimes were committed with a firearm.\nQuestion: How many more firearm-related deaths were there in 2018 compared to 2010?\nOutput:\n38390 - (19392 + 11078) = 38390 - 30470 = 7920. \nSo, in 2018, there were 7920 more deaths by firearm than in 2010.\n\nTask: Write Python code to solve this leetcode problem.\nExample 1\nProblem: You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
